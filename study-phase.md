# Study Phases

Our study employs a rigorous research methodology, designed to assess the effectiveness and usability of DroneWorld. It is structured as a multi-phase study. The first phase is the Learning phase, where participants are given the opportunity to familiarize themselves with its features and functionalities. This is followed by the Tasks phase, which involves configuring scenarios based on specific requirements. Finally, the study concludes with a final interview, where participants are asked a series of questions to gauge their overall impressions of the system.

Throughout each phase, we employ a think-aloud protocol, which encourages participants to articulate their thought processes while using the tool. This allows us to gain insights into how users perceive and interact with the system, as well as identify any areas of difficulty or confusion.

### Phase 1: Learning

1. Introduction to the study, assurance of confidentiality, asking for informed consent.
2. Goals of framework, simulation,  and fuzzy testing is explained and the participant can ask questions.
3. We give them a demo of various components of the web application
4. The participants ask clarification questions, if any. 

### Phase 2: Tasks

1. The participant receives a requirement to test 
2. Participant freely interacts with the application to configure a scenario in order to test the requirement
3. As soon as the simulation completes, we inform the participant to import the result and analyze the results.
4. If they want to configure more scenarios, they are allowed to do. If not, we will proceed to the Phase 3.

### Phase 3: Final interview

### Questions to ask after completing the task

- **How easy or difficult was it configure the given scenarios for testing?**
    - Very Easy - The Scenario configuration required very little effort.
    - Easy - The scenario configuration required some effort or thought, but overall it was not difficult.
    - Moderate - The scenario configuration was neither easy nor difficult, and required a moderate amount of effort or thought.
    - Difficult - The scenario configuration was challenging and required significant effort or thought to complete.
    - Very Difficult - The scenario configuration task was extremely challenging and required a lot of effort or thought to complete, and may have been impossible for some people to accomplish.
- **how much effort did you have to put in to interpret the acceptance test reports shown to you?**
    -  Very Easy -  The acceptance test reports were very easy to interpret and required minimal effort.
    -  Easy - The acceptance test reports were relatively easy to interpret and required some effort, but overall it was not difficult.
    -  Moderate -  interpreting the acceptance test reports required a moderate amount of effort and concentration.
    -  Difficult -  Interpreting the acceptance test reports required significant effort and concentration.
    -  Very Difficult - The acceptance test reports were extremely difficult to interpret and required a lot of effort and concentration to understand.

- **how much did the graphical presentation of flight paths in the acceptance test report help you to better interpret the simulation results?**
-  Not at all helpful - The graphical presentation of flight paths did not help me to better interpret the simulation results.
- Slightly helpful - The graphical presentation of flight paths was minimally helpful in enabling me to better interpret the simulation results.
- Somewhat helpful - The graphical presentation of flight paths provided moderate assistance in helping me to better interpret the simulation results.
- Very helpful - The graphical presentation of flight paths was highly effective in helping me to better interpret the simulation results.
- Extremely helpful - The graphical presentation of flight paths was extremely effective in helping me to better interpret the simulation results.

- **In your opinion, how did our method of checking if the requirements were met compare to how you usually test for issues in general or specifically during simulation testing?**
    - Only asked if they have prior CPS development.
  
- **What new features or improvements could we add to the web app to make it easier and more effective for you? Please provide any suggestions or feedback you may have.**
